    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Beef curry is a rich, flavorful dish made with tender pieces of beef slow-cooked in a blend of
        aromatic spices. The meat absorbs the spices beautifully, creating a deep and comforting flavor
        that pairs perfectly with rice, naan, or roti.
    </p>
    <p> This recipe is simple but full of traditional curry taste. It's ideal for family meals or special
        gatherings, and the leftovers taste even better the next day.
